==========================


My name is Laurids Andersen. I'm from Denmark born and raised just outside Copenhagen. My family and I moved to Sweden at the start of 2020 (a great year btw to move to a new place and meet new people! #corona-sarcasm).

We moved to Gotland because we wanted to experience the unique nature there, but after a year we decided we needed to get a little bit closer to our family in Denmark. We therefore bought a house in Blekinge just southwest of Ronneby.

My partner and I have two children that are 4 and 6 years old.

I graduated as a mechanical engineer from the technical university of Denmark in 2011. Since then I have worked as a consultant and for a wind turbine blade manufacturing company. In my last years of work, I got more and more programming tasks, and I discovered how much potential there was in being able to utilize different data sources available on the internet. As my programming skills are purely self-taught I started getting frustrated with knowing the potential but not completely being able to figure out how to utilize it effectively.

So this is why I'm here in this program.

I currently run a small one-man consultancy, where I do different engineering and small-scale programming tasks.

My hobbies are (when time lets me) watercolor painting, house building, mushroom identification, badminton, fishing, and gardening.

I understand Swedish and speak it with some challenges. The hardest part has shown to be learning to write Swedish, which is why this is done in English.
