# Color schemes

<div class = "date"> November 30th. 2021 <br> <br> </div>

# Introduction
This report is an analysis of the color themes of the websites of the three capital cities of Scandinavia i.e. Norway, Sweden, and Denmark. A discussion will be presented of whether a color scheme has been used and the emotions that the different cities are communicating with the different color choices.

By comparing the color choices of the three largest cities in the Scandinavian countries, it is hoped that one can find out how the different countries try to present themselves and what emotional response the authorities are trying to provoke when communicating to its citizens.
At first, attempts were made with websites that directly represented the countries, but these color choices were directly influenced by the colors of the flags and therefore not particularly suitable for the purpose.

# Method
The colors from the websites are gathered in a table and compared to see if they fit into some general color scheme. The psychological effects of color choice are discussed based on a common understanding of the psychological effect of colors.
Colorzilla is used to pick out the colors from the websites and the software Adobe color wheel is used to investigate whether the color choices fit into a common color scheme.

# Results

## Københavns kommune
The base color on the website is dark blue with high contrast between elements and background.
The corona news is emphasized by being written with a yellow on a dark blue background almost like a breaking news sign. Generally, the first page on the website has very few pictures and colors which together with the dark blue color communicate seriousness and trustworthiness.

If basing the color scheme analysis on the dark blue base color <code>(#000C2E)</code> the other colors chosen on the website seem to match pretty well with a square color scheme. The square color scheme is consisting of three other colors than the base color that are each 90 degrees apart on the color wheel. The square color scheme is often used to create a formal look by choosing a darker shade for the dominant color and then lighter tints for the three other complementary colors [(color-meanings.com)](https://www.color-meanings.com/square-color-schemes/). This is exactly what seems to have been done here.

## Stockholm
The website for Stockholm kommun has a light blue base color that in the large hero image of the Stockholm skyline on an early winter morning creates an easy peaceful feeling. Generally, the website are displaying tinted colors, and only elements that they want to stand out like e.g. search and menu buttons have stronger saturated colors.   

The color scheme is not that easy to identify, partly because the tinted colors don't stand apart very clearly.
Using the Adobe color wheel the square color scheme seems to be the most fitting but it is not completely obvious.  

## Oslo
The website for Oslo kommune does not have a clearly defined base color. The top elements differentiate themselves from common practice by having a white background color. This makes the eye wander further down on the page to a tinted red and orange section that sets the mood of the website. <br>
This section stands out in its use of shapes and colors. The large tinted red box with its dark blue letters catches the eye because of the high contrast, between the red and blue. The two tinted orange circles bind the two halves of the website together by making the eye jump from one side to the other. When hovering over the search button it changes color to a completely different kind of blue. Further, the top navigation bar has two menu boxes on the left and only one on the right. This usage of different colors and shapes casually placed on a white background gives it a modern abstract artistic feel. The website almost resemble constructivism an art form that according to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivism_(art)) is aimed to reflect modern industrial society and urban space.

The color scheme does not seem to match any particular color scheme. The usage of red blue and white might have a linkage to the Norwegian flag.  

# Conclusion
The three different capital cities in Scandinavia have websites that communicate very different things by the usage of colors and shapes.
Based on the results from the analysis then Københavns website has formal look and that communicates seriousness and trustworthiness. Stockholm seem to want to give a more easy peaceful feeling to its website and finally Oslo seems to want to communicate a kind of easy urban modernity.
