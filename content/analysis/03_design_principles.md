# Introduction
This report is an analysis of the design principles used by three tattoo-artists websites. Tattoos are usually made to make the individual stand out in some way or another. It was therefore assumed that the websites of tattoo artists would also be experimental and unique. Three randomly selected websites of tattoo-artist in the Karlskrona area are being reviewed to investigate whether one can trace some underlying design principles in their website layout.

At last, my portfolio page is analyzed, based on the same design principles.

# Method
A google map search of tattoo artist was done in the area around Karlskrona and then three tattoo artist was randomly selected for the analysis. Surprisingly not all artists had a website indicating that a standard homepage might not be the most important communication channel toward customers. This makes the basis of the survey uncertain as resources may not be used on homepage design.

The designs are examined according to the 20 design principles described on [Design elements and principles](https://www.canva.com/learn/design-elements-principles/).  

# Results and Discussion

The front page of the three tattoo-artists homepages is shown below together with a short analysis of the design principles identified in the layout.

## [Underskin.se](https://www.underskin.se/)

<br>
<b>Underskin.se</b> is the website of the three where the most effort has been put into the design. The main element of the page itself consists of a book where you can "physically" flip through the various subpages. This element complies with the "texture" principle. The element is used to give a tactile feel to the website. Tattoos are very non-digital, the book and paint stains are therefore introduced in the design to give a physical and real feeling. Another element that emphasizes this analysis is seen in the gallery. Here, the images are displayed in a frame that makes the images look like polaroid images. Another grip introduced to get the observer back into the physical world, this element could also be grouped under the design principle "framing".

Other distinct design principles that can be spotted on the website are:

- The use of <b>lines</b> to divide the site in to sections.
- <b>Grid</b> (The gallery have a very distinct grid).
- <b>Depth</b> (The book provides depth that helps emphasize the tactile feeling).
- <b>Randomness</b> (paint stains are randomly shown around the site).
- <b>Typography</b> (the logo contains typography that bears the mark of being written with a fountain pen this, in turn, relates to the ink used by tattoo artists but also in the paint stains that are scattered around the page).

One disappointing thing in terms of the design is that nothing has been done to make it work on mobile devices. This is probably i.a. one of the reasons why people are usually holding back with experimental designs. They are often difficult to incorporate across all device types.

## [Madameneedles.se](https://www.underskin.se/)

<br>
<b>Madameneedles.se</b> also has a website that is visually pleasing and interesting.
Unfortunately, the design is destroyed by a large fact box that indicates that the business does not lack customers, therefore the owner can well afford to ruin the original design with a large visually boring fact box that communicates important information that cannot be overlooked.

There is a nice flow <b>(direction)</b> when scrolling down the page. It’s like one’s eyes are running slalom from one side to the other. This flow is created by changing the position of the page headings from left to right. The eyes are caught by the headlines due to the high contrast between the white font and the black background <b>(contrast)</b>, but also because there is a big size difference between the relatively small pictures and the large font <b>(scale)</b>.

When you scroll down, the background color changes from black to white and back to black. This is a way of indicating that there is a new element worth stopping at. This way of showing a new element as opposed to framing it with lines, which might be the traditional way, gives flow and together with the above makes it visually interesting to scroll down the page.

Other distinct design principles that can be spotted on the website are:

- <b>Grid</b> (The pictures and the footer clearly arranged in a grid).

## [Wildbull tattoo art 1](https://wildbulltattooart1.business.site/)

</figure>
<br>
<b>Wildbull tattoo art 1</b> differs from the other two sides by breaking with some of the design principles in an unfortunate way. The result of this is that you as a customer starts asking questions about the design comprehension of the tattoo artist. The pictures of the tattoo artist's work and reviews indicate that he is skillful, which in my eyes makes it strange that they have not chosen a better design for the website.

The design principle that is most blatantly broken is the <b>contrast</b> principle. As a rule, contrast should be used to attract focus on something relevant. Here the contrast between the images and the blue frame makes you focus on the frame and not the images. Further, the contrast between the blue and the brown is generally uncomfortably to look at. Generally when you choose to use high contrast colors like brown and blue then it must have a clear purpose, here it seems like a coincidence and therefore I also consider it as a violation of the <b>color</b> design principle. If you don't know what you doing in terms of color then my advice is to stick to black, and white or at least, less dominant colors maybe using a monochromatic color scheme.  

Other distinct design principles that can be spotted on the website are:

- <b>Grid</b> (The images and text is clearly arranged in a grid).

# Conclusion
Disregarding the last website, tattoo artists websites seem to be visually pleasing and also with some degree of uniqueness. However, it seems that websites are not the main marketing platform for tattoo artists. Therefore, one must be careful not to conclude too much on the tattoo artist's design skills based on website appearance.

# My own portfolio

Compared to the tattoo artist pages, my design is more traditional. In general, I do not know how to use colors in a good way, therefore I tend to stick to a black and white palette.
All my website elements are arranged neatly in a grid. Design elements such as arrows and boxes are also traditionally designed. I'm an engineer and therefore I normally have to communicate professionalism with reports and presentations. It is therefore not straightforward for me to experiment with radical design experiments.

I will see if I can change that in the project!

One thing that I think is a bit different and which I think works well in my portfolio is the contrast between the relatively tight design and the logo which is a European stag beetle. The logo represents a natural element that you do not normally associate with tight lines. This design choice might be introduced as a new design principle that I call "visual contrast".

## Three Implemented Design Principles
As part of kmom06 it was required to implemented three design principles from this [guide](https://www.canva.com/learn/design-elements-principles/).

- <b>(1)</b> I was not satisfied with my front page, it was just a plain text page that needed to be made visually interesting in some way. Inspired by <code>madamneedles.se</code> I decided to work with <b>contrast</b> and <b>lines</b> to create <b>balance</b> between my image and the text. I could have made the border and background color completely black, but then I didn't think it fitted well into the general lightness of the webpage.   

- <b>(2)</b> The gallery page also seemed a bit visually boring considering that it is a gallery and should inspire the viewer visually. Again, inspired by <code>madamneedles.se</code> which I thought created a nice flow <b>(direction)</b> when scrolling down the page. I made the images that were taken in portrait mode higher than the ones taken in landscape mode. Then I placed these images first on the left and then on the right and so on. This makes the eye jump more intuitively between the rows of the pictures in the gallery.

- <b>(3)</b> Lastly, my page needed <b>color</b> and what better place to introduce some color than on a <span class="funky">funky</span> fungi gallery. When telling people I'm interested in fungi people almost always come with a joke about "magic" mushrooms. Mushrooms are in people's minds related to groovy 1970's colors which I then introduced in the background.
